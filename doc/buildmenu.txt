If you use the build-tool Waf http://code.google.com/p/waf, this plugin will
assist you by providing a comfortable sidebar menu which lists all existing
build-targets of your current project. You can select a target and start
building by pressing <Return>. 

This script is still far from being feature complete.

==============================================================================
SETUP                                                        *Buildmenu-setup*

Preconditions that must be met for Buildmenu to work normally:

The {waf} binary and a {wscript} file must be located in |:pwd| (which usually
should be your project root directory). If not then Buildmenu will show
an error message instead of opening the menu.

The vim option |makeprg| must be set to employ the waf binary. To do that
place the following line in your |.vimrc| file: >
   :set makeprg=./waf
<

==============================================================================
WAF                                                            *Buildmenu-waf*

So far this plugin merely works with the Waf buildsystem
http://code.google.com/p/waf. However support of other buildsystems like e.g.
SCons and GNU Make is planned for future versions.

With Waf it is very easy for this plugin to provide a list of build-targets,
because this build system provides a command line argument to list all
targets: >
   $ ./waf list 
<

Not all other buildsystems do provide this feature.

MAPPINGS                                                  *Buildmenu-mappings*

To create a mapping to the command |:BuildmenuToggle| add a line like the
following to your |.vimrc| file: >
   map <YOURMAPPEDKEY> <Plug>BuildmenuToggle
<

Example: Choosing to map the key <F4>: >
   map <F4> <Plug>BuildmenuToggle
<

COMMANDS                                                  *Buildmenu-commands*

:BuildmenuOpen                                                *:BuildmenuOpen*
Opens a new Buildmenu. This menu is opened as a vsplit on the right side of
the screen. It contains a list of all build-targets of your project.

:BuildmenuClose                                              *:BuildmenuClose*
Closes an open Buildmenu. 

:BuildmenuToggle                                            *:BuildmenuToggle*
If no buildmenu is open, then this command acts identically to the
|:BuildmenuOpen| command. If there is already an open Buildmenu, then this
command acts identically to the |:BuildmenuClose| command.

:BuildmenuMake                                                *:BuildmenuMake*
If you already selected a target from the Buildmenu for building, then this
command is added to vim's history of ex-commands. It is equivalent to >
   :mak --targets=<WHATEVERYOUSELECTED>
<
If you did not select anything so far, then issueing this command will merely
execute >
   :mak
<

==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                  *Buildmenu-settings*
